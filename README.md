# VBA Analysis Challenge

## Project Background
The purpose of this stock analysis is helping client obtain and compare *Total Daily Volume* and *Yearly Return* of each target stock in particular year.
By designing a VBA Macro for applying to different years, client can observe and make conclusion which stock performs better than others specifically in green energy industry.
The new refactored macro is created after keeping in mind to analyse huge data sets

## Results

### Analysis comparision

In 2018, only *ENPH* and *RUN* two stocks had positive yearly Return as well as large Total Daily Volume. Both of them was outperformance than others green stocks.
You may also notice that *DQ* made it's return in negatives(-62%). While *AY* had the lowest daily return: 8,30,79,900
